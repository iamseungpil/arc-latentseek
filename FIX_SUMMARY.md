# ARC-LatentSeek Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Executor Success Condition
**Problem**: Shape mismatches were being treated as execution failures, preventing GLM evaluation and LatentSeek optimization.

**Fix**: Changed executor success condition in `src/executors/code_executor_fixed.py`:
```python
# Original:
success = len(error_messages) == 0 and accuracy > 0

# Fixed:
success = len(error_messages) == 0
```

**Rationale**: Only runtime errors should be considered failures. Shape/content mismatches should proceed to GLM evaluation and LatentSeek optimization.

### 2. GLM Message Format Error
**Problem**: "string indices must be integers" error when calling GLM evaluator.

**Fix**: Updated message format in `src/evaluators/glm_evaluator.py`:
```python
# Original:
messages = [
    {"role": "user", "content": prompt, "images": [image_path]}
]

# Fixed:
messages = [
    {
        "role": "user", 
        "content": [
            {"type": "text", "text": prompt},
            {"type": "image", "image": image_path}
        ]
    }
]
```

**Rationale**: GLM-4.1V processor expects content to be a list of dicts with type fields.

## Results

After fixes:
- BARC code generation: ✅ Working
- Code execution: ✅ Working (shape mismatches allowed)
- GLM evaluation: ✅ Working (proper rewards assigned)
- LatentSeek optimization: ✅ Triggered for low-accuracy solutions

## Remaining Issues

1. Device mismatch during LatentSeek optimization (cuda:0 vs cuda:7)
2. Potential memory issues with long sequences in LatentSeek

## Testing

Verified fixes with:
- Single problem tests
- Small validation experiments
- Full pipeline execution shows proper flow
