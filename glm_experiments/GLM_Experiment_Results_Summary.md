# GLM Visual Evaluation Experiment Results

## Overview
This document summarizes the results of GLM-4.1V-9B-Thinking's visual evaluation experiments on ARC problems. We tested GLM's ability to analyze code failures by showing it visual comparisons between expected and generated outputs.

**Test Problem**: `2072aba6`
- **Success**: True (code executes without errors)
- **Accuracy**: 0.0% (outputs don't match expected)
- **Description**: "In the input, you will see a 3x3 grid with a specific pattern of gray pixels. To make the output, you should repeat the pattern to fill a 6x6 grid, and change the gray pixels to blue and red in a checkerboard pattern."

## Experiment 1: Full Image Understanding

### Approach
Show GLM a single image with 3 columns:
- Column 1: Input grids (3x3)
- Column 2: Expected output grids (6x6)
- Column 3: Generated output grids (6x6)

### Results Summary

#### Prompt 1: Direct Evaluation
**Question**: "Looking at the image, is the code correct or incorrect? Why do the outputs in column 3 differ from column 2?"

**GLM's Analysis**:
- **Verdict**: Code is **incorrect**
- **Key Issues Identified**:
  1. **Pattern repetition errors**: The 3×3 input pattern is not correctly repeated to fill the 6×6 grid
  2. **Checkerboard color assignment errors**: Gray pixels are not properly converted to alternating blue/red pattern
- **Specific Observations**:
  - Generated outputs may have misaligned patterns
  - Adjacent cells sometimes have the same color instead of alternating
  - The 2×2 tiling of the 3×3 pattern is not properly implemented

#### Prompt 2: Detailed Pattern Analysis
**Question**: "Please identify: 1) What pattern does the problem actually follow? 2) What pattern did the code implement? 3) How should the description be changed?"

**GLM's Analysis**:
- Started analyzing the actual gray pixel positions in each input
- Identified that the 3×3 grid should be repeated 2×2 times to create 6×6
- Noted that the checkerboard pattern should alternate colors based on position
- However, the response was cut off before completing the full analysis

#### Prompt 3: Step-by-Step Guidance
**Question**: "Based on the pattern from input->expected, suggest a corrected description that would solve this problem."

**GLM's Analysis**:
- Attempted to identify specific differences between expected and generated outputs
- Started mapping gray pixel positions from the 3×3 input
- Noted that the expected output appears to be a larger grid (possibly misidentified as 5×5 or 7×7)
- Response was incomplete but showed detailed position-by-position analysis

## Experiment 2: Row Separation Analysis

### Approach
Create separate images for each training example, showing:
- Input | Expected Output | Generated Output

Test with two methods:
1. **all_at_once**: Send all 3 images together
2. **sequential**: Send images one by one

### Results Summary

#### Approach 1: All at Once
**Prompt**: "Looking at all examples together, why is the generated output wrong?"

**GLM's Analysis**:
- Identified gray pixel positions in each input:
  - Input 1: Gray pixels form a cross-like pattern
  - Input 2: Gray pixels on the diagonal (1,1), (2,2), (3,3)
  - Input 3: Gray pixels in a different pattern
- **Key Issues**:
  1. Incorrect repetition of the 3×3 pattern (not properly tiling to 6×6)
  2. Incorrect color assignment (blue/red positions don't match expected)
  3. Checkerboard pattern not properly applied
- Noted that Generated Output 2 has "mostly blue" instead of proper blue/red alternation

#### Approach 2: Sequential Analysis

**Example 1 Analysis**:
- Identified 5 gray pixels in the input at positions: (1,1), (1,2), (2,1), (2,3), (3,2)
- Noted that when expanded to 6×6, each 3×3 block should maintain the same pattern
- Found specific errors:
  - First cell of generated output is red instead of black
  - Colors don't follow proper checkerboard alternation
  - Pattern repetition is misaligned

**Example 2 Analysis**:
- Identified diagonal gray pixels at (1,1), (2,2), (3,3)
- Calculated that in 6×6 grid, these would map to:
  - Top-left block: (1,1), (2,2), (3,3)
  - Top-right block: (1,4), (2,5), (3,6)
  - Bottom-left block: (4,1), (5,2), (6,3)
  - Bottom-right block: (4,4), (5,5), (6,6)
- Started analyzing checkerboard pattern application

**Example 3 Analysis**:
- Identified 6 gray pixels at: (1,2), (1,3), (2,2), (2,3), (3,1), (3,2)
- Started comparing expected vs generated outputs
- Analysis was incomplete

## Key Findings

### 1. Visual Pattern Recognition
GLM successfully:
- Identified gray pixel positions in 3×3 inputs
- Recognized that 6×6 should be created by 2×2 tiling of 3×3
- Understood the concept of checkerboard pattern (alternating colors)

### 2. Error Detection Capabilities
GLM correctly identified:
- Pattern repetition failures
- Color assignment errors
- Checkerboard pattern violations
- Specific cell-by-cell differences

### 3. Analysis Depth
- GLM provides very detailed, position-by-position analysis
- Uses systematic approach to compare expected vs generated
- Attempts to trace the transformation logic from input to output

### 4. Limitations Observed
- Some responses were cut off or incomplete
- Occasionally confused about grid dimensions (mentioned 5×5 or 7×7 instead of 6×6)
- Sometimes got lost in detailed cell-by-cell analysis

## Conclusions

1. **GLM shows strong visual reasoning capabilities** for analyzing ARC problems
2. **The model can identify specific pattern transformation errors** in generated outputs
3. **Sequential analysis (Experiment 2)** provides more detailed insights than single image analysis
4. **GLM successfully identifies both structural errors** (pattern repetition) and **color mapping errors** (checkerboard pattern)

## Recommendations

1. Consider using sequential analysis for more detailed error detection
2. Provide clearer grid dimension information in prompts
3. May need to increase token limits for complete analysis
4. Multi-tensor evaluation (Experiment 3) may provide even more structured analysis
